# COMP777_MarineHeatwaves
COMP777 Major Assessment, 2019
The following repository has been used for the Megan Trethewy's COMP777 Major Assessment, Macquarie University. 

# Description of the source code 
The code used has been sourced from Eric C. J. Oliver' "marineHeatWaves" GitHub Repository (https://github.com/ecjoliver/marineHeatWaves). This repository highlights the Python code which is the frame work described and used in Hobday, A.J. et al. (2016), A hierarchical approach to defining marine heatwaves, Progress in Oceanography, 141, pp. 227-238, doi: 10.1016/j.pocean.2015.12.014. For this assessment, the RStudio code (which is linked in the README.md page) was used due to previous experience with the program. The RStudio script was developed by Robert W. Schlegel using Oliver's Python code (https://robwschlegel.github.io/heatwaveR/index.html).  

# Contents
README.md: describes the assessment and use of the following codes

Original_R_Code: this is the code sourced from https://robwschlegel.github.io/heatwaveR/index.html

Western Australia Event: this code was used for gathering data and creating the graphs regarding the Western Australia 2011 marine heatwave in Hobday et al. (2016)

Mediterranean Sea Event: this code was used for gathering data and creating the graphs regarding the Mediterranean 2003 marine heatwave in Hobday et al. (2016)

North West Atlantic Ocean Event: this code was used for gathering data and creating the graphs regarding the North West Atlantic Ocean 2012 marine heatwave event in Hobday et al. (2016)

Creating New Data: this code, from https://robwschlegel.github.io/heatwaveR/index.html, was used to get data from the internet regarding the Great Barrier Reef 2016 marine heatwave 

Great Barrier Reef Event: the data from the code created before was then run through the code used for the other 3 events to understand the replicability of the RStudio Script

Cohen's Kappa: this image highlights the calculations made, using a Cohen's Kappa Agreement Analysis, to observe the agreement between 2 observers regarding the replication of the original dataset
